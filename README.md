# 6464MatrixBox
Helloooooo

Just as a heads up this project is mainly just me learning how to code in C++ and with ESP32s yipppeee.

The initial goal with this project was to create a 64x64 matrix that woukd be able to display cool effects. It would do this by connecting to a pc, Google home, or just the internet to do epic stuff. 

Goals:
Streamed video ✅
Offline effects ✅ (only really one effect at the moment)
Computer software control 
Time based effects 

Long term goals:
Google home integration 
Good code structure (I dont understand headers at all)
Bluetooth setup (e.g. connect by bluetooth to set wifi network)
Actually being able to code in cpp
