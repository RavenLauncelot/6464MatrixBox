All data will be sent in the form of UDP packets as bytes.

Before the python script can send a stream request it first needs to find any Matrixes connected to the network.
It will do this by sending a ping packet to the 8888 port of all devices on the network.

Command List in the form of a Byte Array
Commands will be in the form of 3 bytes.

{ (1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) () () } Ping (sent from python script when connecting. Or from matrix when confirming connection still exists)
HEX: 80, 00, 00
Decimal: 128, 0, 0
